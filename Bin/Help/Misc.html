<h3>Miscellaneous Features</h3>

<hr>
<h4>Indenting Lines</h4>
<p>
If you have at least one line selected, you can use <b>Tab</b> or <b>Space</b> to indent
all the lines with tabs or spaces. You can use <b>Shift+Tab</b> or <b>Shift+Space</b> to
unindent the lines.
<p>
<hr>
<h4>Clipboard Swapping</h4>
<p>
You can use <b>Edit>>Advanced>>Last Clipboard</b> or <b>Ctrl+L</b> to restore the text that
was on the clipbaord before the latest copy.
<p>
Additionally, Lite Edit internally maintains two clipboards. You can use <b>Edit>>Advanced>>Switch Clipboard</b>
or <b>Ctrl+W</b> to switch between the clipbaords. Lite Edit displays the contents of the active clipboard in the status bar.
<p>

<h4>Copy/Cut Lines Quickly</h4>
<p>
If there is no selection, copy and cut operate on the entire line.
<p>
<hr>
<h4>Insert Files</h4>
<p>

contents of that file.
<p>
<hr>
<h4>Command Line Options</h4>
<p>
Start Lite Edit from the command line with the /? switch to see the commnad line options
Lite Edit supports.
<p>
<hr>
<h4>Installing Onto Portable Device</h4>
<p>
You can install Lite Edit onto a portable device, such as a USB drive, by simply unzipping all the files in LiteEdit.zip into any folder on the portable device. Do not run the Lite Edit installer to install to a portable device since this will install some files on the host computer system instead of the portable device.
<p>
<hr>
<h4>Porting Syntax Coloring Configurations</h4>
<p>
Each language you configure in the
<b>Options>>Syntax Coloring</b> dialog box is stored in a .lang file. The .lang files
are located in a 'Lite Edit\Languages' sub folder of the public documents folder.
You can port your
syntax coloring settings from one computer to another by copying the .lang
files from one installation of Lite Edit to another. You can also add or
remove .lang files from liteedit.zip to customize which .lang files Lite Edit
installs.
<p>
<hr>
<h4>Advanced Settings</h4>
<p>
Lite Edit's config file, LiteEdit.ini, contains advanced setting you may configure by editing the config file
directly. See comments at the top of the config file for more details.
<p>
The config file is located in the current user's local application data folder. The config file path
is typically one of the following:<br>
%LocalAppData%\Lite Edit\LiteEdit.ini<br>
%UserProfile%\Local Settings\Application Data\Lite Edit\LiteEdit.ini
