<h3>Creating Tools</h3>

You create new tools in the <b>Tools>>Edit Tools</b> dialog box.
<p>
You may specify a <b>Command</b> without a full path. For example,
you may specify a command to launch notepad by using notepad.exe
instead of C:\WINDOWS\System32\notepad.exe.
If the command does not have an absolute path, Lite Edit searches
for the command in the following directories:
<ol>
<li>The directory of LiteEdit.exe.
<li>The 32-bit Windows system directory if one exists. This is typically C:\WINDOWS\system32.
<li>The 16-bit Windows system directory. This is typically C:\WINDOWS\system.
<li>The current Windows directory.
<li>The directories in the PATH environment variable.
</ol>
<p>
You may enter environment variables and any of the following macros
for the <b>Command</b>, <b>Paramters</b>, and <b>Initial directory</b>.
<p>
<table border>
<tr>
	<th>Macro
	<th>Definition
	<th>Example (open file is C:\Folder\File.txt)
<tr>
	<td>%FilePath%
	<td>The full path of the currently opened file
	<td>C:\Folder\File.txt
<tr>
	<td>%FileDir%
	<td>The directory of the currently opened file with trailing backslash
	<td>C:\Folder\
<tr>
	<td>%FileName%
	<td>The file name of the currently opened file without extension
	<td>File
<tr>
	<td>%FileExt%
	<td>The file extension of the currently opened file
	<td>txt
<tr>
	<td>%CurDir%
	<td>The current windows directory
	<td>N/A
<tr>
	<td>%LineNum%
	<td>The one based line number of the caret
	<td>N/A
<tr>
	<td>%ColNum%
	<td>The one based horizontal position of the caret
	<td>N/A
<tr>
	<td>%SelText%
	<td>The selected text
	<td>N/A
<tr>
	<td>%SelStart%
	<td>The zero based index of the start of the selection, or the index of the caret if there is no selection
	<td>N/A
<tr>
	<td>%SelEnd%
	<td>The zero based index of the end of the selection, or the index of the caret if there is no selection
	<td>N/A
<tr>
	<td valign = top>%Prompt:&lt;prompt message&gt;%
	<td>Prompts you for input when the command executes and replaces this macro with the text you enter at the prompt.
		The prompt dialog box displays the &lt;prompt message&gt;. The &lt;prompt message&gt; may use the following
		escaped characters:<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n = new line<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\t = tab<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\\ = back slash<br>
	<td>N/A
</table>
<p>
Below the <b>Command</b>, <b>Paramters</b>, and <b>Initial directory</b>,
Lite Edit gives you a preview of the result of the environment variable and
macro substitution for the currently opened file.
<p>
When specifying <b>Parameters</b>, if an environment variable or
macro expands to a string with spaces, you must enclose the environment
variable or macro in quotes (e.g. "%FilePath%") to ensure that it gets
passed as one parameter. You should <em>not</em> enclose the <b>Command</b> or
<b>Initial directory</b> in quotes.
<p>
Sometimes you
may need to do more to run an external program than you can do in the <b>Edit Tools</b>
dialog box. For example, you want to execute DOS commands such as pause or set
when the program executes. You can do this by creating a batch file that runs the
program and specifying the batch file as the <b>Command</b> in the
<b>Edit Tools</b> dialog box.
<hr>
<h4>Filters: tools that modify the current selection</h4>
<p>
The command can modify the selected text if you enable the <b>Command is a filter</b> option.
A filter is a program that reads text from standard input and writes text to standard output.
When you enable the <b>Command is a filter</b> option, Lite Edit passes the selected text
to the command through standard input. Then Lite Edit replaces the selected text with the text
that the command writes to standard output.
<p>
Filter Examples:
<ul>
	<li>Follow these steps to create a tool that sorts the selected lines of text:
		<ul>
			<li>Open the <b>Edit Tools</b> dialog box through <b>Tools>>Edit Tools</b>
			<li>Press <b>Add</b> to create a new tool menu item
			<li>Set the <b>Command</b> to sort.exe
			<li>Delete the <b>Parameters</b>, leaving this field empty
			<li>Enable the <b>Command is a filter</b> option
			<li>Press <b>OK</b>
		</ul>
	<!--
	<li>Create a tool menu item using a command interpreter, such as cmd.exe or command.com,
		as the <b>Command</b>. Use /c time /t as the <b>Parameters</b>. Enable the
		<b>Command is a filter</b> option. This tool insert the current time by executing
		the DOS time command. /c specifies that the
		command interpreter quits after executing the command. /t specifies that the time DOS
		command doesn't prompt you to input a new time.
	-->
	<!--
	<li>TEXTools is a pipe-based
		text-processing workbench that allows you to morph text into other forms by combining
		filters. You can use TEXTools Command Line (TCL) as a filter in Lite Edit. See
		<a href = http://www.fireflysoftware.com target = _blank>http://www.fireflysoftware.com</a>
		for more information.

		formerly known as TEXTools, is a pipe-based
		text-processing workbench that allows you to morph text into other forms by combining
